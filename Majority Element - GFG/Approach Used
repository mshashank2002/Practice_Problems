Step 1 – Find a elemnt with the majority –

Initialize a variable say i ,ansindex = 0,count =1 
Traverse through the array using for loop
If votes = 0, choose the ansindex =i , make count=1.
else if the current element is the same as the a[ansindex] increment count
else decrement count.
Step 2 – Check if the candidate has more than N/2 counts –

Initialize a variable count =0 and increment count if it is the same as the candidate.
If the count is >N/2, return the count
else return -1.
